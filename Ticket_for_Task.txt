---- Task description created by: Balázs Szabó - 15:32 03/05/2022 ----

We need a matrix operation class which can add matrixes and store the result in a given array which is given by the operation caller.
I wrote some tests which inorm you about the exact requirements, you can find them in the tests/unit/source/RequirementBaseTest.cpp
And there is a another class which define the matrix behaviour, you can find it in the MatrixMethod_lib/source/Matrix.hpp

If it is possible, please don't modify these files beacuse these define the dependencies and requirements for the MatrixMethod class.

Hi @Balázs Szabó,

I checked the ticket and the source and I didn't found any build description (I mean: CMakeLists.txt)
Maybe you forgot them at commit/push.
----


Hi Csaba,

I really forgot about them, but I am unable to find all of them at all.
So you have to make these again, sorry.

Hi @Balázs Szabó,
Ok, I'll create the CMakeLists again.
I think you compiled the tests with dummy implementation, and we woldn't meet with compilation error from RequirementBaseTest.cpp.
Could you confirm this please?

----

Hi Csaba,
Yes, you sholdn't encounter a compilation error, but since it wasn't implemented, so I couldn't check te tester, so probably there are bugs in the tester code.
I may have missed something. Make sense to fix it so that the reqirements don't change. You can conclude the exact requirements from the tester code.
And if your implemetation require more test case(s) you also can expand the file even though I wrote don't touch the RequirementBaseTest.cpp.

I'm trying to understand the code as well as run it. Added/created MatrixOperation.cpp file and implemented TMatrixContainer struct in MatrixContainer.hpp

After many tries and usage of chatGPT I was able to fix dozens of compilation errors in VisualStudio Code terminal
